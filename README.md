# ImageViewer
A program that represents a list of images in a specific format with a lot of classes to improve its "future versions"

I have to say, don't have the time when I needed, yesterday and today I did a lot, not like the other weeks, but I discovered how all it works
and now is a time problem to finish the homework, not an misunderstanding problem...
